GHOST code: Geophysical High Order Suite for Turbulence
=======================================================

The code and different solvers provided here numerically integrate the 
hydrodynamic/magnetodydrodynamic/Hall-magnetodydrodynamic equations in 
2 dimensions. For instalation details, see the README file in the 3D 
directory. Here, we briefly give details of the differences between the 
2D and 3D code.

1. Hybrid support
=================

The 2D code has no hybrid (MPI+OpenMP) support. Only parallelization 
with MPI is available.

2. Solvers 
==========

The list of solvers in the 2D and 3D code differs. See the file SOLVERS 
for the list of solvers available in the 2D code.

3. Input files
==============

Although the format of the input and output files is the same for the 
2D and 3D codes, some options may not be available in the 2D code. See 
the directory "examples" for an example of the "parameter.txt" input 
file for the 2D solvers.
