GHOST code: Geophysical High Order Suite for Turbulence
=======================================================

The code and different solvers provided here numerically integrate 
the hydrodynamic/magnetodydrodynamic/Hall-magnetodydrodynamic 
equations in 2 dimensions. For instalation details, see the README 
file in the 3D directory. Here, we briefly give details of the 
differences between the 2D and 3D code.

1. Parallelization models
=========================

1.1 Hybrid parallelization
 
The 2D code has no hybrid (MPI+OpenMP) support. Only MPI-based 
parallelization is available.

1.2 CUDA support

The 2D code has CUDA (MPI+CUDA) support for GPU-based computation 
of FFTs using CUDA. To use this option, the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 
(the CUDA compilers plus the GPU-accelerated math libraries) must 
be installed in the system, and the path to the CUDA compilers and 
libraries must be declared in Makefile.in. To enable CUDA support, 
pass the following variable to make at compile time:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
P_CUDA=yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

See the README file in the 3D directory for more details.

2. Solvers 
==========

The list of solvers in the 2D and 3D code differs. See the file SOLVERS 
for the list of solvers available in the 2D code.

3. Input files
==============

Although the format of the input and output files is the same for the 
2D and 3D codes, some options may not be available in the 2D code. See 
the directory "examples" for an example of the "parameter.txt" input 
file for the 2D solvers.
