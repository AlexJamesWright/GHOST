Solvers supported by the main code
==================================

0. I/O and FFT libraries
========================

All the solvers and analysis tools work with the following parallel 
FFT libraries (pass 'FFTP=' to the make command to change the default):

   fftp-3 parallel FFT library to link with FFTW 3.x [DEFAULT]
   fftp-2 parallel FFT library to link with FFTW 2.x

and with the following I/O libraries (pass 'IOLIB=' to change the 
default):

   mpiio  MPI I/O, one file for all processors [DEFAULT]
   posix  posix I/O, one file per processor

1. main
=======

The main code is built using 'make' or 'make main'. The following 
solvers are currently supported (pass 'SOLVER=' to the make command 
to build a solver other than the default):

   HD        Hydrodynamic (HD) solver with streamfunction [DEFAULT]
   MHD       Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver (streamfunction-potential)
   MHDB      MHD solver with a uniform magnetic field in y
   HMHD      Hall-MHD solver
