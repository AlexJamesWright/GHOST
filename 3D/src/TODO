The following are a number of ideas for future work that I have thought 
of, or which have been suggested to me.  Let me know if you have other 
ideas, or if there is something that you want to work on.

* Improve the documentation of the output files created by the code.

* Add Alex's routines to compute partial fluxes together with the 
shell-to-shell transfer.

* Write compressible solvers.

* Add FFT-Chebyshev routines to deal with non-periodic boundary 
conditions.
