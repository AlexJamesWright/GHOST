The following are a number of ideas for future work that I have thought 
of, or which have been suggested to me.  Let me know if you have other 
ideas or proposals, or if there is something that you want to work on.

* Improve the documentation of the output files created by the code.

* Add Alex's routines to compute partial fluxes together with the 
shell-to-shell transfer.

* Write compressible solvers (dgomez@df.uba.ar in charge of this?) and 
solvers for stratified flows in the Boussinesq approximation.

* Add FFT-Chebyshev routines to deal with non-periodic boundary 
conditions.

* Implement 1D domain decomposition in the parallel FFTs.

* Full double precision support. Most compilers allow upgrade of 
variables to double precision at compile time, but to make the option 
of double precision easy to use some MPI variables have to be 
overridden, and some name mangling is needed for FFTW 3.x.

* Add the 2D code and solvers to this distribution?
