GHOST code: Geophysical High Order Suite for Turbulence
=======================================================

The files in this directory provide simple examples of how to 
load and plot the output from GHOST using different tools and 
languages often used for data analysis. These files can be 
used as a starting point for more advanced usage of the data.

The codes to numerically integrate the hydrodynamic/
magnetodydrodynamic/Hall-magnetodydrodynamic equations in 2 and 
3 dimensions can be found in ghost/2D/src and ghost/3D/src. 
For instalation details, see the README file in those 
directories.
